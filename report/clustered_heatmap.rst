This heatmap highlights similarities among samples. The euclidian distance of samples has been computed based on the normalized data (considering `{{snakemake.wildcards.design}}` in the normalization process). A ward criterion has been used on these distances to build hierarchical clustering.

We expect samples from the same condition to be similar to each others (i.e. low distance), while being different from other samples (relatively higher distance).

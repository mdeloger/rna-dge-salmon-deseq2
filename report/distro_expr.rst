The distribution of the expression of the genes is a common quality control performed over a differential gene analysis.
This expression distribution has been build on data normalized for `{{snakemake.wildcards.design}}`.

We expect all samples to have similar distribution, otherwise, it would sign a possible error before the end of the normalization process.

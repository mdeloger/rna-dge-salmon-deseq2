This is the representation of the distance between samples: the heatmap shows distance, and the dendrogram highlights relations between samples. This has been computed for `{{snakemake.wildcards.design}}`,  considering `{{snakemake.wildcards.factor}}`.

This image has been obtained with euclidean distance, and ward criterion.

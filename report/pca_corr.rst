With this graph we show the correlation between the studied factors and the axes of the PCA. The higher the bar of the histogram, the more correlated is the factor with the first pca axe. This one has been build on data normalized for `{snakemake.wildcards.design}`.

We expect that first axes will handle the factors of interest.
